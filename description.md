Using images from Reddit's SWF Nature Porn network, EarthTab transforms your new tabs into a window transfixed on the Earth's natural beauty.

Reddit has a treasure trove of beautiful images of Earth, submitted tirelessly around the clock. EarthTab uses these images as backgrounds for your new tabs, offering you a pleasant look at images the Reddit community has declared spectacular.

You can set which specific nature subreddits you would like to pull images from, as well as the frequency that new images are looked for.
