EarthTab pulls images from [Reddit's SWF Nature Porn]((http://www.reddit.com/r/sfwpornnetwork/wiki/network#wiki_nature)) network to transform your new tabs into beautiful windows into Earth's natural beauty.

Head on over to the Chrome Web Store to install.

## Dev Install

For all the cool-ass mofos out there, you can backdoor install the app ([until Google stops letting you](http://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/05/13/chrome-will-soon-force-developer-channel-users-to-install-extensions-from-its-web-store-even-on-mac/)) by following these instructions:

#### Download Repo

Click the fancy "Download as a ZIP" button on the right side of this page, as seen below:

Unzip it once you've downloaded.

You could also simply `git clone` the repo.

#### Dev Mode

Enable "Developer Mode" in Chrome under `chrome://extensions` by checking this box in the top right corner:

#### Load Unpacked Extension

Click "Load Unpacked Extension", which will pull up a menu where you can select a folder. Select the unzipped "EarthTab" folder you downloaded/cloned:

All installed! You should now see a beautiful image, along with the time, displayed as your new tab.

Sadly, installing it this way will not allow for automatic updates. Therefore you will have to repeat this process everytime there is an update to the code. This will not be an issue for people who install the extension via the Chrome Web Store.
