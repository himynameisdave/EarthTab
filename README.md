EarthTab
---

A Chrome extension that scrapes [r/earthporn](http://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/) and makes the current top image the background for your new tab page. Plans to include [other subreddits](http://www.reddit.com/r/sfwpornnetwork/wiki/network#wiki_nature) are in the works.

## Install

Until I post this bitch to the Chrome Web Store (soon, I promise), you can install it the old school way by following these instructions:

#### Download Repo

Click the fancy "Download as a ZIP" button on the right side of this page, as seen below:

Unzip it once you've downloaded.

You could also simply `git clone` the repo.

#### Dev Mode

Enable "Developer Mode" in Chrome under `chrome://extensions` by checking this box in the top right corner:

#### Load Unpacked Extension

Click "Load Unpacked Extension", which will pull up a menu where you can select a folder. Select the unzipped "EarthTab" folder you downloaded/cloned:

All installed! You should now see a beautiful image, along with the time, displayed as your new tab.

Sadly, installing it this way will not allow for automatic updates. Therefore you will have to repeat this process everytime there is an update to the code. This will not be an issue when I (finally) put this up on the Chrome Web Store.
